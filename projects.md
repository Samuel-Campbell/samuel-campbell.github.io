While many sectors of social affairs (health, finance, education) have benefited significantly
from breakthroughs in innovative technologies, the legal profession has consistently lagged
behind its counterparts. Open access to justice is one of the great shortcomings of our judicial
system. People facing legal disputes often become disheartened due to a multitude of factors
including (1) costs and complexity of judicial procedures, (2) delays to reach trial, (3) lack of
knowledge of individual rights of actions and, finally, (4) overall scepticism towards the
efficiency of the justice system.
