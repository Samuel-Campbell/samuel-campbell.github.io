    <p>Hi my name is Samuel Campbell and I am studying Software Engineering at Concordia University!
    </br></br>
    I spent a great deal of time searching for an academic field of interest. I eventually ended up with programming which sparked my interest the same way Pokemon Red did for you and I as children.
    </br></br>
    I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, as well as Embedded Systems.
    </p>
